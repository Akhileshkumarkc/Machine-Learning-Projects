2. K-means clustering on images
In this problem, you will use K-means clustering for image compression. We have provided you
with two images.
• Display the images after data compression using K-means clustering for different values of K
(2, 5, 10, 15, 20).
• What are the compression ratios for different values of K? Note that you have to repeat the
experiment multiple times with different initializations and report the average as well as
variance in the compression ratio.
• Is there a tradeoff between image quality and degree of compression? What would be a good
value of K for each of the two images?
We have provided you java template KMeans.java which implements various image
input/output operations. You have to implement the function k-means in the template. See the
file for more details. Note that your program must compile and we should be able to replicate
your results. Otherwise no credit will be given.
What to turn in:
1. Your code and datasets (in ARFF format)
2. A README for your compiling/using your code
3. A report (pdf or doc file) containing answers to the questions posed.
